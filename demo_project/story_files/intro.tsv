A picture node with for now 3 different channels. I used one for background and 2 for characters in this example.
A speaker label, that can display the speaker if you want to use that function.

You can fill those before you start the dialog with relevant information, so the dialog player gets access to it.
Also it definitly makes filling face-pictures for each window less mind numbing, 
if you can use the same abreviations for each character and only change the GTP.pictures before."		"["""","""",""""]"	700	380	"[["""",""""]]"	"[[0,""7"",0]]"

GTD acts as a transmitter/reciver so you can always connect to that one, other than that you can also just click of one of the nodes in the normal 2d-editor and check what signals each node sends out next to  the inspector tab, connect them directly like that."
